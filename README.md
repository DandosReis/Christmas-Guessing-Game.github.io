# Christmas-Guessing-Game
A fun, family, Christmas-themed guessing game. The game is an idea my wife and I had of combining 3 popular Christmas games; Pictionary, Charades and 30 Seconds. It involves the whole family and all ages. This repository is being used to build the WebApp and maintain the source files. The first phase will be a simple scoreboard for the game.
